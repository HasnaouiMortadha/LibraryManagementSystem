# Library Management System

## Project Overview
The **Library Management System** is a comprehensive desktop application designed to manage a library's key operations, such as tracking books, borrowers, and loans. This project allows librarians and administrators to efficiently add, edit, delete, and search for books, manage borrower information, and keep track of loaned items. The project showcases fundamental concepts of **object-oriented programming (OOP)**, **GUI design**, and **file management**, making it an ideal project for anyone interested in learning or demonstrating their Java development skills.

## Key Features

1. Book Management
   - **Add New Books**: Add books by entering details such as Title, Author, Genre, and Availability.
   - **Edit Book Details**: Update book information when required.
   - **Delete Books**: Remove books from the system permanently.
   - **Search Books**: Use the search bar to find books by title, author, or genre.

2. Borrower Management
   - **Add New Borrowers**: Store borrower details like name, contact information, and unique ID.
   - **Edit Borrower Information**: Update borrower details as needed.
   - **Delete Borrowers**: Remove borrower records from the system.

3. Loan Management
   - **Issue a Book**: Link borrowers to a book loan and track loaned books.
   - **Return a Book**: Update the system to mark a book as returned.
   - **Loan History**: View past and ongoing book loans for tracking purposes.

4. File Management
   - Data persistence through file-based storage (can be upgraded to use a database system like **MySQL** or **SQLite**).
   
5. User Interface (GUI)
   - Clean, simple, and modern graphical user interface (GUI) built using **Java Swing** or **JavaFX**.
   - Tabs for easy navigation: **Home**, **Books**, **Borrowers**, and **Loans**.
   - Functional buttons for quick actions (Add, Edit, Delete, Search) with clear, readable text.
   
6. Real-Time Notifications and Status Bar
   - **Status Bar** at the bottom indicates the connection status and operational feedback.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Java (JDK 17 or higher)
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio Code (VS Code) or IntelliJ IDEA
- **User Interface**: Java Swing or JavaFX (based on user preference)
- **File Handling**: File I/O for persistent data storage (can be expanded to support MySQL/SQLite database)
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for collaboration and project tracking
